# Non-technical Contributors' Workflow

## Story
As a non-technical contributor, I want to add content to the TRG using the new platform setup.

### Questions

- How do I set up the new system?
- Do I need technical help to do any of the setup?
- What do I need to know about how git version control works?
- What do I need to know about how GitHub works?
- What do I need to know about the plain text editor?
- Can I edit directly on GitHub?
- What do I need to know about markdown (the markup language GitHub uses)?
- What do I need to know about the TRG documentation template/s?
- What do I need to know about the TRG documentation standards?
- What is the procedure for uploading my new content/editing previous content.

### Outcomes
The above questions are answered.
I have set up the new system and added content to the TRG.
