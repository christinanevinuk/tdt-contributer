# Markdown introduction
## What markdown is
Markdown is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). Markdown has a simple syntax which leaves the raw document easy to read by humans, as well as machines. Basically, it is normal text, which includes some non-alphabetic characters to mark out formatting.

Content is written in a plain text editor, which can be anything from Notepad or TextEdit, to Atom or Visual Code Studio. Markdown syntax is used to add formatting such as headers, bold text, bulleted lists, or tables. The document is saved as an .md or html.md.erb file. The plain text is converted to structurally valid XHTML or HTML when a webpage is generated from the markdown file.

Because we are using GitHub as the storage site for the Technical Reference Guide (TRG) repository, we will be using [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#GitHub_Flavored_Markdown) (GFM). There are only small syntax differences and additions from standard markdown or any of the other variants of markdown.

## Why we are using markdown
We are moving to the [docs-as-code](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_docs_as_code.html#what-docs-as-code-tools-means) approach for how we edit, maintain and decommission TRG content. By employing the same processes and tools used in software development, we establish a more structured and regulated documentation lifecycle for the TRG. Technical contributors will be familiar with the processes, and the system is easy to learn for non-technical contributors.

Markdown is how content is written using the docs-as-code method. It means documents are easy to write and read, portable, and don't require complicated formatting.
