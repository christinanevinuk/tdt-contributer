# Markdown introduction



To insert an image into your content, use the following:

```
<img src="/images/file-name.xxx" alt="alt text" />
```
<img src="/images/non-tech-contributor-install-workflow.jpg" alt="A description of the flowchart will be written here" />
You must include alt text for an image if the image has not been explained in surrounding content, due to accessibility requirements.
