# Writing Guidelines
## Writing Content

**Be concise**

Write short sentences that explain a single idea. Don’t use multi-clause sentences. Break them up into separate sentences.

**Use simple words**

Avoid <s>polysyllabic</s> long words. Keep it short and sweet.

**Don't use jargon**

Use necessary technical terms, but avoid using jargon. A technical term is a term specific to your subject, and one the reader should know.

**Use the second-person point of view**

Use *you* instead of *the user*.

**Write in active voice**

The active voice is more concise, and there is less possibility of misunderstandings.

Example: use *Change the setting to OFF*, not, *When the setting is changed to OFF*.

**Use consistent verb tense**

Generally this will be present tense.

**Keep it relevant**

Keep to the subject of the content. Although related facts may be interesting, don't add them if they aren't immediately relevant to the content. This is a technical instruction guide, not an article.

## Formatting

**Use headings**

Headings act as a signpost for the reader - they make it easier to navigate the page and sort information. Ensure your headings follow a meaningful hierarchy. Don't nest unrelated content under a higher heading.

**Use whitespace**

Don't use large blocks of text, break the text into short paragraphs. Space out the contents of the page so it is easy to read. Pages with large blocks of text, diagrams and images jammed together are harder and slower to read.

**Spell out acronyms the first time you use them**

The reader may be a new team member, and not know what all the acronyms mean.

Example: the first time the TRG is mentioned on this page, it is written *Technical Reference Guide (TRG)*.

**Use bulleted lists for details; use numbered lists for procedures**

If it is not a sequential set of steps - either a process or procedure - then use a bullet point list.

## Writing Procedures
When writing procedures, look out for these details:

**One task to one line**

Don't have your reader perform several tasks at once. Keep it to one related task, e.g. Select the option you want from the dropdown field and click OK.

**Keep your procedures short**

Information is best absorbed in ≤9 chunks. If your procedure is longer than 9 steps, try to split it into two or more procedures. You can give each procedure a heading to define what stage of the process you are at.

**Write for the technological level of your readers**

Consider what level of subject matter knowledge the majority of your readers will have. If you're unsure they know how to perform an integral task, e.g. create a Pull request, link to the procedure in another page, or to support.

**Don't get diverted**

The procedure should only contain instructions and immediately relevant information. If you need to explain something in detail, don't do it in the procedure. Place large amounts of conceptual/factual information before or after the procedure, and then reference it.

**Keep images beside the task in the procedure**

Don't place them before or after the procedure. Keep images or diagrams as close as possible to the relevant task. Remember to offset them, so they appear part of the procedure, rather than breaking it up.

**Type screen words as they appear onscreen**

Type button names and other onscreen words as they are onscreen. Using alternate names, no matter how common, can lead to confusion.
