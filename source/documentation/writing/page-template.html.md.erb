\# Page title

An introductory sentence, explaining what this page will cover.



\## Section title (heading 2)

Write relevant content here. This should include an explanation of what the procedure will instruct on. Procedures are detailed step-by-step instructions to achieve a given goal. If the content here is too long, break it up into paragraphs. Solid blocks of text are harder to read.

If you have any factual or conceptual information that relates to the procedure, it should be put here, or after the procedure. You can reference it in the procedure, but don't put it in the procedure. If necessary, place it under heading 3 - see below.



### Procedure title (heading 3)

1.  Use numbered lists for procedures, use bulleted lists for details or points

2.  One task to one line

3.  Keep your procedures short. Split them up if they become too large

4.  Write for the technological level of your readers

5.  Keep images beside the task in the procedure.

6.  To insert an image use the following HTML: <img src="/images/imagefile" alt="image alt text" />

7.  Type a description of what is in the image in the 'alt' field, replacing image alt text.

8.  Type button names and other screen words as they are onscreen



### Content title (heading 3)

Any factual or conceptual information that relates to the procedure should be put after or before the procedure. You can reference it in the procedure, but don't put it in the procedure. If there are other documents which should be used in association with the page's contents (for example, a test form or spec document), these should be linked to, not just mentioned.

If you want to list components, points or details, use a list like the following. The markdown - dashes will generate as bulletpoints in HTML:

- detail1

- detail2

- detail3



#### Content title (heading 4)

If you want to write content which is included but subordinate to the heading 3 content, use a heading 4 title. Remember to use plenty of whitespace in your document, as it makes it much easier to read. If you want to create a table for details, use something like the following:

Food | Type | Tropical
--- | --- | ---
Banana | Fruit | Yes
Aubergine | Vegetable | No
Apple | Fruit | No
