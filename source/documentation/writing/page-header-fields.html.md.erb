# Page header fields

Each page requires a header. This data is not displayed on the page.
Example:

```
---
title: Page header fields
weight: 50
last_reviewed_on: 2021-10-20
review_in: 22 weeks
---
```


The header should contain:

- **- - -** 3 dashes to mark the beginning and end of the header

- **title** - the title of the page. This should be the same as the header 1 title (#)

- **weight** - this number sorts where the page will display in the sidebar menu. The lower the number, the higher the position in that section.

- **last_reviewed_on** - this date has a yyyy-mm-dd format. When you change or review content, you must enter the date. It is important this is kept up to date, as regular reviews of the content are scheduled and alerts sent, based on that date.
