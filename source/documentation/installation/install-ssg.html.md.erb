# SSG Installation
If you want to work offline with a code editor, you must install the static site generator (SSG) to your local machine.

## Middleman
This may be installed using a Docker container. Yet to be decided. To install Middleman, see the official [installation documentation here](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/).

The Middleman SSG is used with the Government Digital Services' (GDS) Technical Documentation Template (TDT). To install the TDT see see [**Template installation**](/documentation/installation/install-template.html.md.erb) for details.


## Docusaurus

The Docusaurus template can be installed following the official [installation documentation here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

The Docusaurus SSG includes an integral template. This may be customised for MDTP. Yet to be decided.
