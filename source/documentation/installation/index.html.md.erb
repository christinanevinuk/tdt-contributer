# Installation

If you want to work solely online, the only action you must take is to acquire a GitHub account.

If you want to work offline, you must install extra software. What needs to be installed varies depending on how you want to work. See [**Content Creation**](/documentation/organisation/content-creation.html.md.erb) for details.
