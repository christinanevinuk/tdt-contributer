# Installation

If you want to work solely online, the only action you must take is to [**get a GitHub account**](/documentation/installation/get-github-account.html.md.erb). If you already have one, you can use that.

If you want to work offline, you must install extra software. What needs to be installed varies depending on how you want to work. See [**Content Creation**](/documentation/organisation/content-creation.html.md.erb) for details.

## Basic option
For the basic offline working option, you will need to install the following:

- [**Git**](/documentation/installation/install-git.html.md.erb)
- [**Cloned TRG repository**](/documentation/installation/clone-repository.html.md.erb)
- [**Git client**](/documentation/installation/install-git-client.html.md.erb) (optional)

## Advanced option
For the advanced offline working option, you will need to install the following:

- [**Git**](/documentation/installation/install-git.html.md.erb)
- [**Cloned TRG repository**](/documentation/installation/clone-repository.html.md.erb)
- [**Git client**](/documentation/installation/install-git-client.html.md.erb) (optional)
- [**Static site generator**](/documentation/installation/install-ssg.html.md.erb)
- [**Template**](/documentation/installation/install-template.html.md.erb)
- [**Code editor**](/documentation/installation/install-code-editor.html.md.erb)

Further help with technical problems with the TRG is available on the **#trg-tech-support** Slack channel.
