#Clone GitHub repository
If you want to work offline, you will need to make a copy, or clone, the TRG GitHub repository onto your local machine. You can then create a branch of the repository, make changes, and then push the changes back to GitHub to be merged into the main branch.

The repository will already include the .git folder.

## Use command line/terminal
## Use GitBash
## Use Git client
## Use code editor

(Atom, Gitkraken, Visual Studio Code)
